The UndoManager is a small, self-contained example sub-system. You can 
use any IDE if you like, you can find the sources in the "src" directory. 

It consists of a couple of interfaces that all play together to fulfill 
the task of tracking, undoing and redoing changes to some text document. 
You can think of it as a sub-system of a text editor.

The task is to understand the interfaces and what role they play in the
UndoManager context and then, based on this understanding, write
implementations of ONLY the UndoManager and UndoManagerFactory interfaces.

What methods do you know to ensure that the code actually does what it
is supposed to do? Apply them!

Please send the implementation of the classes, including any tests, back by email.
